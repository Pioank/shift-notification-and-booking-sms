# shift-notification-and-booking-sms

## Description

Companies might have extra shifts for their employees, which are considered overtime and are not allocated. These shifts are usually communicated in advance and employees who are seeking to generate extra income can book them. There are two parts in this process:

- The company communicating the available shifts to employees who are interested
- Employees confirming, which of the available shifts want

Such use cases involve employees who hold manual posts with little access to the internet. SMS is the preffered channel to communicate available shifts as well as receive the employees' requests. Using SMS ensures that everyone can receive and book available shifts with no accessibility issues.
